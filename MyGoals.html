                        As I continue to develop my career, my primary objective is to leverage my background in business analysis, project management, and IT systems to transition into roles focused on Data Analytics, Business Development, and IT Strategy.
                        Building on my experience with relational databases, SQL Server, and process optimization, I aim to further expand my skill set in data visualization tools and machine learning, enabling me to extract actionable insights that can drive informed business decisions. My goal is to contribute to an organization's growth by providing innovative solutions through data-driven strategies.
                       Additionally, I am passionate about business development and am focused on acquiring the skills necessary to lead strategic initiatives, fostering partnerships, and identifying growth opportunities in competitive markets. I aspire to work in environments where I can apply my technical expertise while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful results.
                       In the IT realm, my focus is to deepen my knowledge in system architecture, cloud computing, and cybersecurity to help businesses streamline operations, enhance security, and maximize efficiency. I aim to be at the forefront of technological innovation, contributing to enterprise-level solutions that drive operational success.
